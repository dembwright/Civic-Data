# Civic-Data

Open Data is important for governments at all scales. They improve transparency for accountability and build trust in society. Most importantly, they create well-informed citizens!

### [US City Open Data Portals](./US-Cities-ODPs.md)
Some cities are more modernized than others. If you notice that a city has updated its data site, please let me know. If there is a city not on the list, please let me know. Enjoy!
